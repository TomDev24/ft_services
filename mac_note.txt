1)Check memory
du -sh ./$(ls -A)

2)ln -s link_to imagine name
-do that for .brew   .minikube  and .brewconfig

2)you need docker mahcine installed (brew, and minikube also)
3)docker machine create
-- dont have to, minikube handles itself

############FROM BEGINING
--->goinfre went empty, but some symbolic links still remains
1)BREW installation
https://github.com/kube/42homebrew

2)i putted brew in goinfree
cd ~
mv .brew ./goinfree
ln -s ./goinfree/.brew .brew

3)brew install minikube

4).minikube -> goinfre/.minikube
.docker -> ./goinfre/.docker
so they too should have symbolic links

5) i had to delete old .minikube file from home directory
and create link to .minikube again
